# ProxyPatternExample
This code is a *simple* way of implementing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_pattern">proxy pattern</a> in an application where combo boxes based on JSF (<code>selectOneMenu</code>) need to be cached so it's loaded from the database only once. The proxy pattern plays the role of lazy loading the collections.

This was done in a standalone demo with classes respecting the naming convention of the MVC pattern (implemented with JSF and Spring).

## Requirements
* Eclipse
* JDK 8+

## How to use?
Simple clone this Git repository, import the project in Eclipse and run the <code>UserGenderCTL</code> class. Documentation and tutorial is done in the code as comments.

## Licence
Free to use as is. No proprietary code is there. This was developed as part of the **Java Practice** of CGI Quebec.
