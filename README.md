# ProxyPatternExample
This code is a simple way of implementing the proxy pattern in an application where comboboxes based on JSF need to be cached so it's loaded from the database only once. The proxy pattern plays the role of lazy loading the collections.

This was done in a standalone demo with classes respecting the naming convention of the MVC pattern (Impemented with JSF and Spring).
